## Intro
I know that climate change is a serious problem.  I know that my lifestyle makes it worse.  And I know I should change or cut out those behaviors that make my carbon footprint unjustifiably high. But I don't.  Besides buying wind power once during a stint in a past apartment, I haven't taken many other actions to meaningfully reduce my footprint.

Reflecting on this made me wonder why.  Was it because the changes would be too hard or costly?  Was it because I didn't know what to change?  Though I didn't figure it all out, what became clear after a bit of thinking was that even though I "know" a lot (I've seen An Inconvenient Truth and read plenty of NY Times articles) I was still ignorant of basic facts relevant to changing my behavior.  

In particular, I didn't know what the scientific consensus was for allowable warming, or how much carbon we could collective emit to stay under that target.  I didn't know what my personal carbon quota should be or where my current footprint was in relation to that goal.  And I didn't know the specific actions I could take to get within that quota.  What follows is a report of what I found attempting to answer those questions.

## The Problem
The dyanimcs of many physical systems critical to human (and animal and enviornmental) well-being are [strongly influenced by global temperature](https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg2/ar4_wg2_full_report.pdf).
  This includes (but is far from limited to): levels and melting rates of snow, ice (glaciers, polar ice caps, etc.), and frozen ground, affecting not only sea levels, but also glaicial runoff, ocean salinity, and habitat for many species; terrestrial biological systems such as the timing of spring related events (leaf unfolding, animal migration), the size and location of plant and animal habitat; marine and freshwater biological systems, like the ranges and volumes of algal, plankton and fish abundance, ranges and migration times of fish and other species; precipitation levels, storm formation and intensity, drought and desertification, flooding, plant productivity, forest fires, dry season length. [CITATION]
  
The amount of "greenhouses" gasses in the atmosphere is a primary driver of temperature.  These gasses (including carbon, methane, [TODO: ADD OTHERS]) trap energy from the sun that would otherwise be radiated back into the atmosphere as ifrared light, warming the air and raising average atmospheric temperature [CITATION].  Scientists studing this relationship estimate that every metric ton of CO2 leads to an approximately 0.0000000000015 degree increase in mean surface temperature [CITATION].

![Temperature Increase and Atmospheric Carbon](../images/temp_increase_per_ton.png?rev=1)

Over geological time the amount of atmospheric carbon has fluctuated in a roughly cyclical pattern (due to volcanic eruptions, etc), but has been relatviely stable arount 200 ppm for the last 10,000 years.  

![Historical Atospheric Carbon](../images/historical_carbon_800k.png?rev=2)

Since industrialization, however, the concentration of these gases has increased __X__ percent, leading to an estimated __X__ degrees of warming to date.  The International Panel on Climate Change has confirmed that the release of greenhouse gases due to human activities is the primary driver of the recent temperature increase, with 95% certainty [CITATION].

![Historical Atospheric Carbon](../images/historical_carbon_1k.png?rev=1)
 
If carbon emissions grow at historic rates, scientists estaimate a roughly 3.5 degree temperature increase by the year 2100, which would have __catestrophic__ implications for many countries, communities, and ecosystems throughout the world.  The IPCC estimates, for example, that such a level of warming would lead to (among many other things): extinction of up to or exceeding 40% of the worlds plant and animal species, widespread coral mortality, significant shifts in species' range, hundreds of millions of people exposed to increased water stress, a doubling in frequency of the strongest Atlantic cyclones, loss of about 30% of global coastal wetland, millions exposed to coastal flooding, significant increase in insect-born diseases due to expanded ranges, widespread crop failure, a 50% increase in extreme drought in the US and Souther Asia, a 20% rise in the likelihood of potentially lethal daytime tmperatures in the United States and China, as well as the risk of significant future increases in temperature due to the release of hundreds of gigatons of carbon and carbon equivalents currently stored in permafrost throughout Siberia and the poles [CITATION].


## Target Emission Levels
### What goal should be set for warming and carbon emissions?
 Given the stability and flourishing over the last 10,000 years, the presumed ideal would be to no warming.  Unfortunately, as carbon is cumulative and long-lasting (it stays in the atmosphere for approximately 1000 years) [CITATION], we'd need to average emissions of negative 5 billion tons per year for the next 84 (with zero emissions thereafter) to "undo" historical emissions.

Though geoengineering holds out the promise of removal of carbon from the atmosphere, it's currently not feasible, so the question is to what extent can emissions be reduced without doing more social and economic harm than we would avert [CITATION: ECONOMIC POLICY MAKING AROUND CLIMATE CHANGE].  The choice of the extent of reduction depends on thehe how the consequences associated with various degrees of warming are evaluated - be they evaluated by economic cost, harm to human health, harm to ecosystems, to future generations, etc.

In December 2015, representatives from around the world [TODO: who were they, how many countries, which countries, etc.] met in Paris, at the so-called "Convening of the Parties" or COP (a meeting held under the auspices of the U.N.) to set a global warming target and make commitments to emissions reductions necessary to achieve that goal.  The parties ultimately set a target of 1.5 degrees of warming by 2100 [TODO: add how they selected that number][TODO: CITATION].  Emissions beyond that number, they concluded, made the likelihood of catestrophic warming too great [TODO: enumerate reasons why].

1.5 degree target means we have a global, all-time carbon "budget" of about about 1,000 gigatons or 1 trillion metric tons of carbon and carbon equivalent emissions.  To date, we've released nearly 500 gigatons [TODO: CITATION], meaning we have approximately 500 gt to emit over the next 84 years.  Given current emisisons and emission growth rates, we're on track to exhaust our budget by __YEAR Y__, meaning we'd need a cumulative reduction in emissions by __X__ percent each year.

### Who is going to make those reductions?
Who is going to make those reducitons and how they'll be made are incredibly difficult political questions.  The question of how to divide the remaining the 500 gigatons raises significant questions of fairness, history, need, and ability to contributes.

Many developing countries argue that division rules insensitive to their development (and accompanying levels of carbon emissions) needs would unduly harm their abilities to improve the lives of their citizens.  Why, they argue, should their people be deprived of basic improvements in well-being so that otherwise perfectly well-off westerners can indulge their high-consumption lifestyles?  Developed countries have for the majority of their histories, developed without restriction on emissions.  Expecting developing countries to develop under harsh carbon restrictions constitutes a double standard.  Developed countries should take responsibility for their high-carbon paths to development and take on the majority of reductions.

Developed countries on the other hand cite practical considerations for adopting a "grandfathered" or "inertial" rule of division.  The reductions required by the equity approach would be so drastic that they'd require economic and legal changes that have no chance of being adopted by the people of those countries.  They argue instead for gradual but accelerating reductions that allow of economic, political, and technological adaptation to reduction.


## My Contribution
As one who believes in the rationale for a 1.5 degree temperature goal and wants to be "part of the solution" rather than a perpetuator of the problem, this raises the question: what do I need to do to be part of the solution?  

This question, unfortunately, is not an easy one and just raises others:

  - What should my carbon quota be?
  - Where am I in currently relation to that goal?
  - What options are available to reach that goal?

### What should my carbon quota be?
The primary arguments against equity focus on the practical impediments to adopting steep reductions and on the burdens they would impose on the countries with the highest current emmissions.  Compelling as those arguments might be from an international treaty-making perspctive, they doesn't address the _truth_ of the proposition that we're each only entitled to an equal share of global carbon quota.  It may be the case that the difference between my personal quota and current lifestyle would require reductions that are (even very) difficult, but unlike a large democratic country, I'm a well-off individual with significant abilities to change lifestyle and adapt (regardless of how unpleasant those changes might be).

Dividing the quota up over the next 36 years, and then dividing that by the projected population at each year gives the following yearly quotas up to 2050.

![Personal Carbon Quota](../images/personal_carbon_quota.png?rev=2)

[TODO: ADD TEXT INDICATING WHICH TEMPERATURE LEVEL EACH IS ASSOCIATED WITH]

### Where am I in relation to that quota?
Where am I currently in relation to that roughly 700kg per year goal?  What is my current carbon responsibility?  Unfortunately, computing an accurate personal carbon footprint is difficult and burdensome.  The areas of one's life and activities that generate carbon liabilities are numerous, diverse, and difficult to track.  Generally, they're bucketed into four broad aread:

 1. Transportation-related carbon, including plane trips, car trips, use of public transportation
 2. Housing-related carbon, from heating, cooling, & electricity
 3. So-called "embedded" carbon, or the carbon that's emitted in the process of producing and transporting goods we consume
 - Other liabilities, like my share of the US Govenernment's carbon footprint.

Fortunately, technologies and new institutional data sources are facilitating the tracking of quotidian behaviors and new models are being used to compute the carbon footprints of these behaviors. Below are charts that use [Moves](https://www.moves-app.com/) and [Con Edision Green Button](http://www.greenbuttondata.org/) energy data along with carbon calcualtions from the [Brighter Planet API](http://impact.brighterplanet.com/documentation) to compute my personal carbon footprint for transportation and housing over the last two years.

![All time cumulative transportation carbon footprint](../images/cumulative_footprint_by_year.png?rev=1)

As the chart indicates, my carbon footprint is pretty high.  For each of the two years with full data, my footprint from transportation alone exceeded 13,000 kgs of carbon, meaning I was 1700% above my quota each year. Another way of looking at my overshoot is that if everyone in the world had a similar footprint, we'd likely see 9 degrees of warming, an amount that would likely spell the collapse of humanity. 

![Temperature Increase Per Ton with Targets](../images/temp_increase_with_targets.png?rev=3)

[TODO: FIX AXES RELATIONSHIP, THESE NUMBERS ARE WRONG. ADD TEXT FOR FOR CURRENT AND TARGET]


### What can I do to get within my quota?
So what can I do to reduce my footprint and get within the amount I'm entitled to?  The natural place is to reduce the amount of carbon I'm responsible for through behavior and lifestyle changes.  A big start would be reducing the number of flights I take per year.  Plane flights dominate all other modes of transportation and for me are responsible for 10 times as much carbon as the next highest mode, cars.

![Footprint Without Flights](../images/cumulative_footprint_by_year_wo_flights.png?rev=4)

![Total Footprint by Type](../images/total_footprint_by_type.png?rev=1)

I average about 8 [CHECK THIS NUMBER] flights a year, and with each flight's carbon averaging my entire quota, that's going to be hard for me to elminate.  Outside of reduction, my options are offsets and advocacy for policy change.  (Scientists and policy-makers also disucss technical solutions, like geoengineering and carbon capture and sequestration, but I can only lobby for those things, not do them myself).

Carbon offsets work by supporting projects that reduced carbon emissions.  They include activities like reforestation (forests act as a carbon sink, reducing total atmospheric carbon), investments in renewable energy projects (like wind or solar), or destruction of industrial pollutants.  They have the benefit of allowing individuals (and insititutions) the ability to reduce their carbon responsibilities without having to make drastic changes to lifestyle.

They aren't without drawbacks though.  Accounting for exaclty how much carbon is being reduced by a given project is a challenge.  It can take years, for example, for a reforestation project to begin pulling carbon out of the air in significant quantities, and there's no gaurantee about how long those trees will stay there.  Offsets can also create perverse incentives for polluters.  A manufacturing company for example, generated 500 million dollars in offests for equipment to destroy industiral pollutants that only cost 5 million dollars to implement.  They later went on to produce more polluting factories just to get the offsets.

[Giving What We Can](http://preview.givingwhatwecan.org/report/2CFCCfUSi4icqeS6emE046) has identified [Cool Earth](https://www.coolearth.org/) as a highly effective organization to donate to for carbon reduction and Charity Navigator has given the [Carbon Fund](https://carbonfund.org/) its [highest rating](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=12315).

[TODO: GIVE MORE DETAILS ABOUT MY DECISION-MAKING AROUND OFFSETS]

Another option is supporting the advocacy for national policies that would address climate change on a much larger scale.  Though riskiker, this approach has the potential to have much more impact than any individual contribution.  Organizations like the [Citizen's Climate Lobby](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/) (also highly regarded by [Giving What We Can](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/charity/ccl/)) advocate for a [carbon fee and dividend](http://citizensclimatelobby.org/carbon-fee-and-dividend/) policy to reduce greenhouse gas emission by 52% over 1990 levels.

[TODO: ADD OTHER LOBBYING OPTIONS]


### Aftwerward: Is this the best way for me to spend my time and money?
Meeting my personal carbon quota is important, but it's not my only moral obligation.  Donating time and resources to other charities and causes, doing my civic dutiy in other respects, and so on have competing claims on my time and resources.
