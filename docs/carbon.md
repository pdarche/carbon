7/30 work plan

 - research temperature-sensitive physical systems
 - citation for degree / ton temperature number
 - identify amount of carbon released since industrialization and find source
 - get data of historical carbon levels
 - research consequences of the "business-as-usual" pathway
 - research justification for the 1.5 degree warming increase

## The Problem
 - The dyanimcs of many physical systems critical to human (and animal and enviornmental) well-being are strongly influenced by global temperature.  
  - sea ice levels influence the jet stream, the movement of salt in the oceans
  - rainfall levels across the planet - influencing crop yields, arable land
  - disease transmission
  - food supply
  - storm intensity
  - heat and habitable areas
  - other extreme events
 - There are many drivers of global temperature, one primary lever is the concentration of "greenhouses" gasses in the atmosphere.  These gasses (including carbon, methane, [TODO: ADD OTHERS]) trap energy from the sun that would otherwise be radiated back into the atmosphere as ultraviolet light, which warms air in the atmosphere and raises the average atmospheric temperature.  Scientists studing this relationship estimate that every metric ton of CO2 leads to an approximately 0.0000000000015 increase in mean surface temperature [TODO: citation].
 - Since industrialization, the concentration of these gases has increased [TODO: ADD AMOUNT] (and the International Panel on Climate Change has confirmed that the release of greenhouse gases due to human activities is the primary driver of the recent temperature increase, with 95% certainty) [TODO: CITATION], leading to an estimated warming of __X__ degrees over [TODO: ADD TIME PERIOD].

![Placeholder for chart of carbon levels over history]()
 
 - If carbon emissions grow at the same rate they have historically, we're on track to see a __X__ degree increase by the year 2100 
 - This would, in short, __be catestrophic__.
  - extreme events
  - food shortages
  - heat waves
  - disease transmisison
  - ocean acidification

## Target Emission Levels
### What goal should be set for carbon emissions?
 - Presumably, the ideal would be to have no warming [is this the case?].  Unfortunately, since carbon is long-lasting (it lasts in the atmosphere for approximately 1000 years) and cumulative, we'd need to average negative emissions of __Y__ tons for the next 84 (with zero emissions thereafter) to achieve that goal.
 - Since this isn't feasible, the question is to what extent can we reduce emissions without doing more social and economic harm than we would avert.
 - In December 2015, representatives from around the world [TODO: who were they, how many countries, which countries, etc.] met in Paris to set a global warming target and the steps that each would take to reach the emissions cuts that would be required.  After weeks of deliberation the parties set a target of 1.5 degrees of warming by 2100 [TODO: add how they selected that number][TODO: CITATION].  Emissions beyond that number risk catestrophic warming 
- [TODO: enumerate reasons why], which justifies even siginifican economic outlays. [TODO: fill in with more details]
- 1.5 degree target means we have a global, all-time carbon 'budget' of about about 1,000 gigatons.  Since we've already emitted 500 gigatons [TODO: CITATION], we're down to 500 gt to emit over the next 84 years.
- Given current emisisons and emission growth rates, we're on track to exhaust our budget by __YEAR Y__, meaning we'd need a cumulative reduction in emissions by __X__ percent each year.

### Who is going to make those reductions?
- Who is going to make those reducitons and how they'll be made are incredibly thorny political questions.  The question of how to divide the remaining the 500 gigatons raises significant questions of equity and historical fairness.  Developing countries argue that significant reductions would do disproportionate harm to them, and that their historical emmissions pale in comparison to that of developed countries.
- Should the remaining 500 gigatons be distributed equally amongst countries?  Why not the the 1000 gigatons of total allowable emmissions?  If the latter, developed countries, like the US, UK, China, etc, will have already used most of their slice [TODO: CITATION].
- Or should some different criterion be used, like equity or inertial?  Should ability to pay, development needs, or current emmissions levels be used to set targets.  A new proposal has been floated called ‘contraction and convergence’, in which overall global emissions contract to a safe level while all countries steadily converge on a common per capita emissions level.
 - Regardless of distribution by country, an ultimate common target has been generally upon: per-capita carbon limit.

## My Contribution
- As one who believes in the importance of meeting these goals, and wants to be someone who is 'part of the solution' rather than the problem, this raises the question: "what do I need to do to be part of the solution?"

- That raises three questions:
  - What should my carbon quota be?
  - Where am I in relation to that goal?
  - What actions can I take to get there?

### What should my carbon quota be?
 - Competing approaches
  - equality
  - equity
  - inertia

### Where am I in relation to that goal?
- Personal carbon footprint are generally composed of:
 - Transportation
 - Housing (heating/cooling, electricity)
 - Embedded carbon from consumption
 - Other carbon responsibilities (i.e. my share of the US Govenernment's carbon footprint)

![All time cumulative transportation carbon footprint](../images/cumulative_footprint_by_year.png)

- as you can see from the above chart, for the two years with full data, my footprint from transportation alone exceded 12,000 kgms

### What can I do to get there
- Reductions
 - Reducing flights
 - Reducing cab rides
 - Replacing subway trips with bike rides
 - Replacing short car rides with bike rides
- Offests
- Lobbying
 - Carbon taxes
- Geoengineering
 - Carbon capture and sequestration
- Carbon Pricing
